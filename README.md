## About/Purpose ‚ùî
---
This application is meant to only be a back-end for a theoretical e-commerce website containing products, tags and category models.  It contains the basic routes for GET, PUT and DEL. This application comes equipped with a `schema` and `seeds` file to get you started with your database which should be mySQL.


## Setup
1. Install all depencies
    * `npm i`
2. Configure your .env file
    1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
    2. Input the following details:
        * DB_USER=
        * DB_PW=
        * DB_NAME=
        * DB_HOST=
        * DB_PORT=  
2. Run Schema to create the database
    * `mysql -u {user} -p`
    * `{password}`
    * `source db/schema.sql`
    * `exit` to go back to bash terminal
3. Run Seeds to inject sample data
    * `node seeds/index`
4. Run the program
    * `node server`
5. Setup your `requests` in `Postman` or `Insomnia`
    * If using `Postman`, for convenience, import the below into `Postman`
        * `./assets/ecommerce-backend.postman_collection.json`
6. Test the routes :)
